### Cochis - Klara Mar

Implicit Progamming (IP) mechanisms infer values by type-directed resolution, 
making programs more compact and easier to read. Examples of IP mechanisms include 
Haskell’s type classes, Scala’s implicits, Agda’s instance arguments, Coq’s type 
classes, and Rust’s traits. The design of IP mechanisms has led to heated debate:
proponents of one school argue for the desirability of strong reasoning properties;
while proponents of another school argue for the power and flexibility of local 
scoping or overlapping instances. The current state of affairs seems to indicate 
that the two goals are at odds with one another and cannot easily be reconciled.

This talk presents COCHIS, the Calculus Of CoHerent ImplicitS, an improved variant
of the implicit calculus that offers flexibility while preserving two key properties:
coherence and stability of substitutions. COCHIS supports polymorphism, local 
scoping, overlapping instances, first-class instances, and higher-order rules, 
while remaining type safe, coherent and stable under substitution.
